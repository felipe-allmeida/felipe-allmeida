<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p align="center">I'm a software developer passionate for <b>#software-architecture</b>, <b>#ci-cd</b> & <b>#opensource</b></p>
  
<p>I am senior software engineer in the infinite cycle of learning. I've been learning a lot lately and decided in early 2020 to share that knowledge in a community I created called [Pampa Devs](https://github.com/Pampa-Devs).</p>
